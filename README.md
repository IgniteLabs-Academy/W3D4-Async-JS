# Week 3 - Day 4: fetch API, JSON, LocalStorage

## ðŸ§  Real-World Scenario
You're building a web page that fetches user data from a public API and saves user input to the browser's localStorage.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task
Complete `index.js` (and optionally an HTML file):
1. Use `fetch()` to get a list of users from [JSONPlaceholder]
    (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).
2. Parse the API response using `.json()` and display the users' names and emails.
3. Create a form that takes user input (e.g., name, email).
4. Save the form data to `localStorage` on submit.
5. Retrieve and display stored data when the page reloads.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Scoring
- Fetch API works and displays data: 20 points
- JSON is parsed and handled correctly: 20 points
- Form saves data to localStorage: 20 points
- Data is retrieved and shown on reload: 20 points
- Error handling and code quality: 20 points

## ðŸš€ Steps
1. Open `index.js` and complete the required logic.
2. Use ES6+ async patterns and fetch API.
3. Use JSON methods for data handling.
4. Use localStorage for saving and retrieving data.
5. Use the sample fetch code above to get started.
6. Refer to the slides for real-world examples and expected results.
